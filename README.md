# datadome-captcha
Documentation for the datadome captcha challenge payload. Includes encryption and all that.

# Purpose
This is meant to be learned from, not pasted into your project. I also didn't collect a lot of sample payloads, there may be some obscure things in some payloads on some browsers that just weren't on mine but all and all, datadome is pretty easy to reverse engineer anyways. I'm not including the deobfuscator in this, have fun making that :)
